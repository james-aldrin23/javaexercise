   <p>Hi my name is <b>James Aldrin M. Odiong</b> currently residing here in <b>Nasipit, Talamban</b>. I am a certified student in <b>University Of San Carlos-TC</b>. 
    I am <b>20 years old.</b>
    My <b>current college life</b>  is quite challenging because we do <b> online class</b>. <b>Online class</b>  is very <b>hassle</b> knowing that it can only be accessed <b>virtually</b>. 
    Many things I need to <b>adjust</b> such as how to go with the <b>flow</b>, <b>heptic schedules</b>, <b>overloaded subjects</b>, and lot of <b>unfinish projects</b>. All I need is to <b>manage my time</b> properly, prioritize <b>important things</b>, and of course avoid  <b>temptations</b>.
    These things would possibly help me far from <b>procrastination</b> and some <b>delayed</b>. I do believe that <b>IT</b> is not an easy <b>course</b> except to those student who is <b>more passionate</b> about it. But in the long run, I slowly <b>adapt</b> the environment. If you're dealing the problem 
<b>proactively</b> pretty sure you can see <b>improvements and changes</b>. So far, I am so <b>blessed</b> because besides of those <b>difficulties</b> I still have my <b>batchmates</b>, <b>friends</b>, and <b>families</b> who never stop <b>motivating</b> me. It really helps me in all <b>aspects</b>.
In addition, I am also blessed to be here in <b>Passerelles Numeriques</b> because not just providing me all my needs but they also <b>mold</b> my <b>character</b> and help me to be the better <b>version of myself</b>.
